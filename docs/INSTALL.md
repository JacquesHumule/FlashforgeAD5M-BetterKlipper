### Installation

The mod uses the installation mechanism of the stock firmware. Download the latest `Adventurer5M-*.tgz` release to a USB flash drive and plug it in before starting the printer. Note: if you are using the 5M Pro, please rename the archive to `Adventurer5MPro-*.tgz`, otherwise it's not detected by the installer.

After successful installation, the printer will by default start the mod system instead. If the mod is re-installed or updated, all local modifications are lost. Only the G-Code files are retained.

At the moment, the mod only allows installations on printers that were updated to version 2.4.5 of the stock firmware.
