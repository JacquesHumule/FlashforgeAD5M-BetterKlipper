# LCD Brightness

The LCD Brightness can be controlled with the `LCD_ON` and `LCD_OFF` macro. The default is 50% brightness.

To set the brightness run the gcode macro `LCD_ON VALUE` with _VALUE_ set to 1-100, use LCD_OFF to disable the backlight.

From the commandline `backlight X` can be used with `backlight 0` turning the backlight off.
